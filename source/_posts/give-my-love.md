`mabe it's just a fairy tale story in reality or in drama but i still believe that at the last dance, we'll be together...`

When I look in your eyes I can see that you
Wanna be with me but you?ˉre so scared
And I don?ˉt know what to say or do
But the tears keep falling from your eyes
And I know that
Times won?ˉt change my love
And I can?ˉt do nothing to keep you
oh, I?ˉll give my love oh when I hold you tight
Give my love through kisses oh so bright
And you know that I can?ˉt change my love
Take my love all through the night?-
As the hours pass away
You think that love ain?ˉt here to stay
Feel a beat from your chest
But you don?ˉt give doubt a moment?ˉs rest
You dream the future and all you see is dark
Listen to your heart, baby, the truth will set sparks
Now
I?ˉll give my love oh when I hold you tight
Give my love through kisses oh so bright
And you know that I can?ˉt change my love
Take my love all through the night
Now I?ˉll give my love oh when I hold you tight
Give my love through kisses oh so bright
And you know that time won't change my love
Take my love all through the night
I?ˉll give my love oh when I hold you tight
Give my love, through kisses oh so bright
And you know that I can?ˉt change my love
Take my love all through the night
